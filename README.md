Fracture testing for polymers : python script for creep compliance calibration method

In the pdf "Script_Fracture_testing_for_polymers" it is briefly explained what the script does and what is is useful for.
The main script is roughly 1000 lines of code and it is stored in the .txt file "Script_Analisi_Creep_Commentato"
In the script are defined 3 folder at the beginning where the data to be analyzed is present and where the output is saved.
I have appended zip files containing some examples of input files and output files as reference.
